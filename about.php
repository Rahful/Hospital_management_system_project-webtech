				<h3>Dhaka Medical College and Hospital was established in 1946 during British colonial rule. Since its establishment, Dhaka Medical College is continuously playing a pioneering role in dispersing medical education among young pupils. The hospital attached with the college provides affordable health care to a huge number of patients through its outdoor, indoor and emergency facilities. Over time, the original 100-bed hospital has grown to become Bangladesh's largest hospital. After adding the 500 beds in 2013, it now contains 2300 beds.
				</br></br>
				Presently the hospital is functioning full swing with only 40% of approved manpower including indoor, outdoor, surgery, pathology, radiology, dialysis and burn unit etc. Due to paucity of manpower, budget and other logistics, some departments, like Blood bank, ICU, CCU, Neuro-medicine, Nero-Surgery, Psychiatry, physical medicine etc. are yet to begin. </br></br>
				Hospital is now vibrant with almost 21-2500 outdoor patients and 300-350 indoor patients daily.Since its journey began, it has proved its uniqueness by serving humanity and working towards only proposed green hospital in public sector. </h3>
